### optional: 
Creating the groups can be done using "create_groups.py", when data is in local mysql-server.

AfterWards, project the graph using "projections.py" file. dimensions can be changed in configuration "conf.ini"

Use "labels_data.py" to create dictionary of labels from the tree. This dictionary will be used by the model.

### model
